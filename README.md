NYC Open Data - Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes

This database uses a multitude of factors to input details on a car accident including but not limited to:

Weather, longitutde, latitutde, severity, time and date of accident over the course of many years.

## Reason for Topic
Our goal is to have insurance companies use this model to help determine the appropriate coverages based on vehicle make and year in the state of NY.

## Questions to Answer
- What make is more likely to get into an accident in NY?
- What were the contributing factors that were most common that may affect insuring someone in NY?
- Are there certain circumstances of accidents depending on location/direction of travel?
- What are contributing factors that happen before an accident that may affect insurance?
- How many accidents are caused by NY residents vs. Out of state visitors?

## Communication Protocols
Our team regularly chats via our Slack channel and regular Zoom calls.
### Assigned Roles:
- Daniella Padilla: Database - creating database with provided dataset using AWS and Postgres
- Patrick Dawson: Machine Learning - testing unsupervised model
